                                <p>I have been a member of LPTN since 2021. I started off as a county chair where I quickly got placed into the role of interim regional chair. After getting the region organized with a constitution, trying to grow the membership and conducting events internal and outreach I won the unanimous support of my region and I was voted in. I then moved his aim toward the state party where I created SOP’s to help guide the future of the party. I also took on the roll of IT support for the state party. Now I will continue my work as a state officer and look forward to a bright future ahead of LPTN with my new partners in the fight for liberty.</p>

                                <p>I first got involved in politics in 2012 as a volunteer for the Ron Paul campaign after watching some of his videos on YouTube. Since joining the party in 2019, he’s worked on multiple campaign teams, including as Social Media Director for Tennessee for Jorgenson/Cohen 2020. He’s also Director of the State Fundraising Committee, former Director of the Convention Committee and served as Whiskey Region Coordinator from 2021-2023. Keith grew up in South Carolina, briefly lived North Carolina, and has proudly considered himself a Tennessean since 2005. His biggest issues are the economy and foreign policy.</p>
